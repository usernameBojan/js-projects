This ATM Interface is a solo side project built at the end of the subject Basic JavaScript Development and finished approximately towards the middle of the subject Advanced JavaScript Development at SEDC Web Development Academy. Whereas it’s author (i.e Me) is totally aware of the facts that it serves no real life purpose and application, that ATM Interfaces aren’t created with HTML and JS and that almost all programs and algorithms about ATM’s were long ago written in languages other than JavaScript, the solely purpose of this project was exercising of many important concepts in JavaScript and combing them in one functional program, gradually expanding and upgrading the code and it’s functionalities and thus learning about and practicing code sustainability.
