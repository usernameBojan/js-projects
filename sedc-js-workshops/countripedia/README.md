This project begun as an exercise for workshop for the subject Advanced JavaScript Development for the Seavus Academy for Web Development 2021/2022 with tasks only referring to being a SPA and having a functional search bar and a buttons which show english speaking countries and countries using euro.
I later upgraded its features with adding more filtering options and creating a modal window for each country card, which provides little more information about the country than the card itself and gives a link which leads to wikipedia page of that particular country.
